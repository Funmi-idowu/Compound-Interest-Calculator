**Compund Interest Calculator**
Welcome to my Compound Interest Calculator web app. The web app consists of two pages. The first being the home page where you will find general information on compound interest and an image of the formula that will be calculating your compounded interest. The next page you will find is the calculator page. This page is where you will be able to input information specified towards you in order to get your estimated compound interest total.
